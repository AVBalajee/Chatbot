# Chatbot
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
Users communicate with these tools using a chat interface or via voice, just like they would converse with another person. Chatbots interpret the words given to them by a person and provide a pre-set answer.

Chatbots, also called chatterbots, is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) used in messaging apps. This tool helps add convenience for customersâ€”they are automated programs that interact with customers like a human would and cost little to nothing to engage with.
